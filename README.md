# Vanilla refresher

## What is this?

This portion of the homework is a list of JavaScript tasks that touch on some fundamental JavaScript concepts.

## Why are we doing it?

Since we've been digging in so deeply into some complex topics, we want to take a step back and refresh some of the fundamentals outside the context of the more challenging stuff (like Express). This isn't a test and will not be graded or anything. The main purpose that it serves is for us to try to pin-point particular areas that we can have review sessions for. Since we have project week next week, we'll set aside an hour here and there for optional review sessions on some topics. The TAs may also do the same if we want to focus on particular things for longer periods of time.

## How do we do it?

We want you to do these tasks **by yourself** and **closed book**. The goal is not to test anyone. We really want to know what we should focus on for the review sessions. Are you completely stuck on classes? That's fine, we'll review it. I want to get an accurate account of what we need to review. We'll likely have mini, optional reviews for most of these topics so don't feel like you **should** know any particular task.

When you try some of the DOM tasks, feel free to use DOM documentation, the MDN site or W3 schools.
